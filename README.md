Berlin-AI-shivanmax
===================

So Max and I took part in a Ruby Hacknight organized by HardCoder Labs on 10th Sept 2013. The objective of the night was to design an AI for an online multiplayer Risk-like (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)) game called Berlin (github link: https://github.com/thirdside/berlin-ai). We built the AI in the allotted one hour, and ended up placing third in the tournament. There were about 17 participants, with almost all being experts (most of them had beards). 

I didn't have my own machine at the event, so porting all our code was an issue; the stuff up here is from the initial stages of our design (~30 minutes into the event).
